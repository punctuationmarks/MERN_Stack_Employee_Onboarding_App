# MERN Stack backend employee app
CRUD app for local coffee shop that focuses on having information for unboarding new employees and 
keeping current employees up-to-date. Since their menu is seasonal, they needed something that could
be updated quickly and move fast.


- Built with flexibility in mind
	- MongoDB allows the database to be flexible as the client's desired information changes
	- Easy to refactor since React, Express and MongoDB are quite commonly known technologies
	- Can be deployed easily through Heroku, AWS, or on a Linux Server

- Built to be mobile first but also features a nice desktop layout, easy to enter new data on the fly



- Things this project needs:
	- Testing
	- Refactoring, possibly moving away from REDUX, depending on the future of React Hooks



Website, not open to public, but can see a version on [Heroku](https://cfcc-backend.herokuapp.com/)
